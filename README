- The dataset is highly imbalanced and contains anonymized features.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Model Highlights
- Model: Logistic Regression
- Accuracy: ~87%
- Metrics: Confusion Matrix, ROC AUC, Classification Report

## 📁 File Structure
- `Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_LogReg.ipynb`: Main notebook
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies
- `.gitignore`: Ignore sensitive or large files
- `creditcard.csv`: Dataset (should not be committed)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the root folder
3. Install dependencies:
